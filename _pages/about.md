About Steven (Jinghang) Li
======
By training, I am a materials scientist and bioengineer with great expertise in implantable biomaterials design. Working with synthetic and natural polymers, modified through chemical and physical methods, I gained insights in how interdisciplinary research benefits scientific advances. However, the often-overlooked immunology in implantable materials and drug delivery research motivated me to learn immunology. Upon entering the immunology realm, I have been fascinated by the beautiful complexity of the immune system. I used transgenic mouse models and murine viruses to study antigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cell response (immunity or tolerance) in the context of viral infection in a tissue-specific manner under inflammatory and non-inflammatory conditions. In adaptive immunity, B cells, or antibody-producing B cells (plasma cells) also play a role in different diseases such as autoimmune disease such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). I am currently using molecular cloning strategies to elucidate the etiology of the autoantibody presence of environmental triggers such as viral infection. In the future, I am aiming to bridge B cell and T cell immunology to elucidate often overlooked immune crosstalk in cancer, autoimmune disease, working with AI scientists to develop therapeutics to address real-world challenges.
